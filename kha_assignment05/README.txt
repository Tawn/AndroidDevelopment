ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION

This assignment practice the transferring of data between the Host Activity and it’s Fragments; and also from Fragment to Fragment via Host Activity. By using the Host Activity, it obtains a user’s input of a string to create a new Fragment to the upper-third of the mobile display. From the upper-third a user inputs another string to send back to the Main Activity, then create the bottom third fragment with that text. By using fragments, allows cleaner and less codes by not repeating contexts in other activities; instead just uses the same one where necessary.
