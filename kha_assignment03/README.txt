ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION

Learning how to use ImageButton; similar to a regular button, except youâ€™re able to include images. Another new feature was learning to store and restore states; in this assignment, we had counted the number of rotation. Whenever the screen rotates, the program will store the intended information then can be restored through the onSave and onRestore methods provided. This assignment has given more practice managing the regular widgets; manipulating their state and behaviors.
