ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION

This assignment has enabled me to practice how to persist the data when creating and destroying new activities. This included practice with fragments; there was more emphasis towards data transferring from activities-to-activities. This assignment was mixed with Assignment 03; using the onSaveInstance and onRestoreInstance methods; with logging every action. We have also learned how to configure the landscape and portrait of the application.
