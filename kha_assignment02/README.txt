ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION

This assignment taught me to use different layouts for the programs, included nested layouts, for the programs structures to be more flexible when displayed in the emulator. I have also implemented the functions of the three buttons; two to display toasts; and one to decrement the text by 1 from 100-80, which will then resets to 100 when it reaches 80 (for a quicker test result).
