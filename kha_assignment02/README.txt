ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION

This assignment taught me to use different layouts for display, which includes nested layouts, for the programs structures to be more flexible when the program is displayed in the emulator. I have also implemented the functions of the three buttons; two to display toasts; and one to decrement the text by 1 from 100-80. The decrementing button will resets to 100 when it reaches 80 (for a quicker test result).
