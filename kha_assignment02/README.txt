ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION

This assignment taught me to use different layouts for display, which includes nested layouts, for more flexibility when arranging the objects. I have also implemented the functions of the three buttons; two to display toasts; and one to decrement the text by 1 from 100-80. The decrementing button will resets to 100 when it reaches 80 (for a quicker test result).
