ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION

This super complex assignment practiced the use of ListView, RecyclerView, and PageAdapter, which allows smooth scrolling and swiping. I have a single PageAdapter that controls one of each fragment of each view (List and Recycler). Provided a collection of Pokémon, and when an item is clicked, it’s description is shown. The start of the application is the ListView of the collections, and when you swipe to your right, it’s the RecyclerView of the collection. The advantages of using a RecyclerView than the ListView is that RecyclerView is more flexible; providing more layouts and flexible sizes of every element.
